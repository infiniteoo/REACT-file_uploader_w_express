# REACT - File Uploader with Express

### About

In this project we build a full stack file upload app with React, Express, and construct the UI
with Bootstrap elements.

### Issues

For whatever reason I was unable to decipher, the markup in the JSX for the file uploader and the alerts don't look or work as showcased on the getboostrap.com website, even though Bootstrap's CDN is linked correctly, and the code matches the examples on their website. Overall, the functionality (other than the alert) is the same, but the look isn't as cool. Nonetheless, a lot of was learned from this project.
